O
A
O
SCANDAL
O
IN
O
BOHEMIA
O
I
O
.

O
To
O
Sherlock
O
Holmes
O
she
O
is
O
always
O
the
O
woman
O
.

O
I
O
have
O
seldom
O
heard
O
him
O
mention
O
her
O
under
O
any
O
other
O
name
O
.

O
In
O
his
O
eyes
O
she
O
eclipses
O
and
O
predominates
O
the
O
whole
O
of
O
her
O
sex
O
.

O
It
O
was
O
not
O
that
O
he
O
felt
O
any
O
emotion
O
akin
O
to
O
love
O
for
O
Irene
O
Adler
O
.

O
All
O
emotions
O
,
O
and
O
that
O
one
O
particularly
O
,
O
were
O
abhorrent
O
to
O
his
O
cold
O
,
O
precise
O
but
O
admirably
O
balanced
O
mind
O
.

O
He
O
was
O
,
O
I
O
take
O
it
O
,
O
the
O
most
O
perfect
O
reasoning
O
and
O
observing
O
machine
O
that
O
the
O
world
O
has
O
seen
O
,
O
but
O
as
O
a
O
lover
O
he
O
would
O
have
O
placed
O
himself
O
in
O
a
O
false
O
position
O
.

O
He
O
never
O
spoke
O
of
O
the
O
softer
O
passions
O
,
O
save
O
with
O
a
O
gibe
O
and
O
a
O
sneer
O
.

O
They
O
were
O
admirable
O
things
O
for
O
the
O
observer
O
--
O
excellent
O
for
O
drawing
O
the
O
veil
O
from
O
men
O
'
O
s
O
motives
O
and
O
actions
O
.

O
But
O
for
O
the
O
trained
O
reasoner
O
to
O
admit
O
such
O
intrusions
O
into
O
his
O
own
O
delicate
O
and
O
finely
O
adjusted
O
temperament
O
was
O
to
O
introduce
O
a
O
distracting
O
factor
O
which
O
might
O
throw
O
a
O
doubt
O
upon
O
all
O
his
O
mental
O
results
O
.

O
Grit
O
in
O
a
O
sensitive
O
instrument
O
,
O
or
O
a
O
crack
O
in
O
one
O
of
O
his
O
own
O
high
O
-
O
power
O
lenses
O
,
O
would
O
not
O
be
O
more
O
disturbing
O
than
O
a
O
strong
O
emotion
O
in
O
a
O
nature
O
such
O
as
O
his
O
.

O
And
O
yet
O
there
O
was
O
but
O
one
O
woman
O
to
O
him
O
,
O
and
O
that
O
woman
O
was
O
the
O
late
O
Irene
O
Adler
O
,
O
of
O
dubious
O
and
O
questionable
O
memory
O
.

O
I
O
had
O
seen
O
little
O
of
O
Holmes
O
lately
O
.

O
My
O
marriage
O
had
O
drifted
O
us
O
away
O
from
O
each
O
other
O
.
